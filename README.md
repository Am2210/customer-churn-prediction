customer-churn-prediction
Machine Learning model for predicting customer churn

This project predicts customer churn using machine learning with a Random Forest Classifier.

Project Overview
- Dataset: [Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- Model: Random Forest Classifier
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries Used: pandas, scikit-learn, joblib

How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `customer_churn.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to train the model.
4. Use the saved model `customer_churn_model.pkl` to make predictions.
